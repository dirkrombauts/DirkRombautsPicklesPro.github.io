The collaboration between all roles in a project team is an essential part of Behaviour Driven Development. There can be many roles in a team, but we usually assume three roles: business, development and test. It needs at least those three roles to make sure that the resulting specification

1. will answer the business need,
2. will be technically feasible, and
3. will be adequately verified.

Representatives from these three (and potentially other) roles will meet to discuss requirements. They will work out a specification by coming up with examples.

<del>[Gojko Adzic](http://gojko.net/) coined the term "Three Amigos Meeting" for those sessions, probably as a whimsical reference to the [1986 movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092086/).</del> **Update 25 May 2016**: [George Dinwiddie](http://idiacomputing.com/) and Bob Payne coined the term "Three Amigos". 

I recently explained about BDD and the Three Amigos to a stone merchant and a marketing consultant. They are two intelligent people, and have no experience with software development. I stressed the importance of the three roles working together. Without the team, none can succeed, and the team needs each one to succeed. I think it was the marketing consultant who said "so it's like the three musketeers: one for all, and all for one."

I immediately liked this comparison. I never watched the *Three Amigos* movie, so I don't know how good their teamwork is. But I do know that the Three Musketeers are famous for sticking with each other through thick and thin &ndash; exactly the quality I am looking for in a team.

So here's my bold statement for today: **I think that *Three Musketeers* is a better name for the Specification By Example workshops than *Three Amigos*.** What do you think? Please let me know!
