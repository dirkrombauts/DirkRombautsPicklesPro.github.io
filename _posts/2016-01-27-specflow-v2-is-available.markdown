[SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org) v2 is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecFlow) as of today, as Gáspár Nagy - the creator and brains of SpecFlow - announced on [his blog](http://gasparnagy.com/2016/01/the-day-when-specflow-v2-is-released-and-after-roadmap/) today. Gáspár sounds proud of the accomplishment of himself and of the SpecFlow community, and rightly so. I'm proud of this release as well, in a transitive fashion: SpecFlow v2 uses the new v3 version of the [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin) parser, and I contributed some code to make the .NET version of the parser releasable.

[TechTalk](http://www.techtalk.at/?lang=en-US) already released a new version of their [SpecFlow+ Runner](http://www.specflow.org/plus/runner/). I'm proud to say that [Pickles](http://www.picklesdoc.com) followed suit on the same day that SpecFlow v2 was released! This is the moment when all that time spent writing and maintaining a suite of unit tests paid big dividends.

I share Gáspár's hope that v2 of SpecFlow will not be an end, but the beginning of many interesting developments in the Behaviour Driven Development on .NET sphere.
