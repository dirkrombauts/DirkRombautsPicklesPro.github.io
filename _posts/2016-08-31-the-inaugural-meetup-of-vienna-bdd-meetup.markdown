I am very proud to announce the [inaugural meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vienna-BDD-Meetup/events/233392038/) of Vienna BDD Meetup, a Vienna-based group dedicated to Behaviour Driven Development. We will meet regularly to swap knowledge and ideas about BDD, and to build a community.

The first meetup will take place on Wednesday 14 September 2016 from 18:00 until 20:00. The location, food and drinks will be provided by [TechTalk](http://techtalk.at/), one of our sponsors. The other sponsor is of course [Pickles Pro](http://www.picklespro.com/), my very own company.

The program for the inaugural meetup is:

* Get to know each other
* Discuss the goal(s) of the group
* Andreas Willich will do a short presentation about [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org) - Cucumber for .NET
* I will do an even shorter presentation about Living Documentation and [Pickles](http://www.picklesdoc.com/), the open source Living Documentation generator
* Mingle, chat and enjoy food and drink

I'm very excited about meeting you all, talking to you about Living Documentation, and listening to your BDD stories. [Sign up now](http://www.meetup.com/Vienna-BDD-Meetup/events/233392038/) for our meetup!
