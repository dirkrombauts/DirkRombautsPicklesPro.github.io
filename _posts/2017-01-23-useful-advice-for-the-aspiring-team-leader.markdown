*Elastic Leadership* is the second edition of Roy Osherove's book about leadership (the first edition is called *Notes to a Software Team Leader*). I read both editions. In this post, I review the book and indicate a significant improvement of the second edition over the first one.

The book is divided in two parts: the first part where Roy Osherhove writes about team leadership, and a second part where other people (both well-known and not-so-well-known) share some insights and stories, with comments by Roy Osherove.

I like how the first part shows a clear evolution. Roy Osherove describes a model for the evolution of a software team, and then proceeds to give advice for each of the three phases. The advice is clearly situated in the context of the phase the team is currently in. So in theory, if your team is in the first phase, you could get away with reading just the first few chapters until your team moves to the next phase.

What I do not like about the first part is that Roy Osherhove makes no mention of other models for the evolution of a team. There is for instance the "forming–storming–norming-performing" model proposed by Bruce Tuckman in the 60ties. At first glance, the two models seem similar. In reality they are not, because they describe the evolution of different aspects of teams. Still, the initial similarity is big enough that Tuckman's model warrants a mention in the book.

The guest chapters provide a wide variety of topics. In this second edition, Roy Osherove provides comments to each contribution, to place it in the context of his model, its phases and forces that influence teams and people. I think that these comments are a significant improvement of the second edition over the first one.

The book contains a lot of advise, given in a direct and no-nonsense manner. As such, the book is firmly targeted at people who are taking their first steps as a software team leader. Experienced leaders who benefit from more nuanced discussions should look elsewhere.
