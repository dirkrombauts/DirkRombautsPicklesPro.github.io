Last week, I attended
[CukeUP! 2016 London](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7606-cukeup-2016),
the definitive BDD conference in Europe. It was a fantastic experience: I got
to meet many interesting people, to learn (and try out) new insights and
techniques. And I delivered two lightning talks, which were received very well
even if I say so myself.

The conference was organized by Skills Matter and took place at CodeNode. There
was plenty of food and drink, good wifi, and lots of space. A big thank you to
the crew of Skills Matter who took such good care of us!

## Keynote: Kind of Green

The keynote of day one was delivered by
[Aslak Hellesøy](https://twitter.com/aslak_hellesoy) of Cucumber fame.
Presenting BDD as a Jazz concept album, he went through all stages of the BDD
workflow. Each stage was presented as a song. Fittingly, the songs about the
*Specification By Example* part of BDD were grouped on Side A, and the songs
about the *Outside-In Development* part were grouped on Side B. Aslak
illustrated each song with a tasteful drawing.

As a music lover myself (although not so much of Jazz) I really dug this
presentation!

## 7 Reasons why BDD is not for you

The first talk of day one I attended was by
[Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne), also of Cucumber fame. Matt
outlined 7 reasons why BDD may not be good for you. Most of them have to
do with unrealistic expectations and unfavorable preconditions. Matt also
mentioned a number of benefits of BDD that you will reap if you manage to
overcome the obstacles.

Not much new information for me here, but wrapped up in a concise and at times
entertaining package.

## Workshop: What do you really know about your customers

The first workshop of the day, presented by
[Kate Gray](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/kate-gray). She gave us
some tools and methods to help us finding out who our customers really are
and what their needs are - not what we thinks their needs ought to be.
She spent some time explaining the differences and goals of
qualitative studies versus quantitative studies.

A lot of new information for me, that I will need to digest before I can
make any kind of judgement about this workshop.

## Workshop: A Planning Meeting You'll Love

This workshop was presented by [Gáspár Nagy](http://gasparnagy.com/)
of SpecFlow fame and by Matt Wynne who wrote the article
[Introducing Example Mapping](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction).

Gáspár and Matt played through a planning meeting for a user story with
volunteers from the audience. They first did it in a traditional way, and then
a second time using Example Mapping. With Example Mapping, discussions were
much more concrete than without. They discussed fewer features in detail, but
there was less uncertainty at the end of the discussion. Then the audience got
their chance to try the technique.

Example Mapping seems very useful tool to have in my toolbelt, and Gáspár and
Matt did a good job of guiding us through it.

## How testers can be a liability for your team.

By [Ulrika Malmgren](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/ulrika-malmgren).
About how having a dedicated "QA" person can turn testing into
"somebody else's problem". She discussed a number of ways to get non-QA people
more involved with and better at testing.

Ulrika is not a showy presenter, but her message is worth listening to.

## Lightning talks

### Making your first pull request

By [Charlotte Spencer](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/charlotte-spencer).
She presented *Your First PR*, an initiative to get more people involved in
open source projects.

### Why Team Size and Story Size Matter

By [Arti Mathanda](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/arti-mathanda).
She presented her experience with improving velocity and performance by
splitting a big team in two small teams.

### The Dark Side of BDD

By your truly :-). This talk is not inspired by a Pink Floyd album, but
by the temptations that can lure you away from productive BDD by promising
optimizations. In reality you will end up compromising one or more of the three
goals of BDD: Common Understanding, Living Documentation, Outside-In Development.

Thanks to everyone for listening to me, and thanks to the many people who talked
with me afterwards and said so many complimentary things about my talk.

### Living Documentation for commandline applications - A contract between you and your users

By [Dennis Günnewig](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/dennis-gunnewig)
of Aruba fame. About how to test commandline applications (or scripts) and how to use
those tests to document the applications.

### BDDfire - Get up and running with Cucumber, Docker and Gatling in a minute

By [Shashikant Jagtap](http://shashikantjagtap.net/) where he presents BDDfire,
a Ruby framework that sets up a directory structure with configuration files
to use a lot of popular development services in your application.

Stay tuned for my impressions of day two ...
