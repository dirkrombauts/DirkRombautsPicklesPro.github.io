Behaviour Driven Development is a very rich methodology, in that it covers a wide spectrum of activities. There is something to do for Product Owners, Business Analysts, Developers, Architects, Testers, ... That begs the question: how do you and your colleagues obtain the knowledge you need?

<!--more-->

Developers have perhaps the easiest way of obtaining their knowledge: they can experiment in Visual Studio, read blogs, or search on Stack Overflow. The other roles have it much harder. They can watch a couple of videos on the [SpecLog Getting Started page](http://www.speclog.net/getting-started/) but those are very much focused on using SpecLog.

There are a couple of good books that I recommend: [Bridging the Communication Gap](https://books.gojko.net/bridging-the-communication-gap/) and [Specification by Example](https://books.gojko.net/specification-by-example/) by Gojko Adzic, and [The Cucumber Book](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book) by Matt Wynne and Aslak Hellesøy.

However, those books will "only" tell you what BDD is about, not so much how you do it. The Cucumber Book goes some way toward showing you how BDD works in practice, but sadly it is Ruby-specific - I hope there will be a .NET "port" of the book soon!

So in answer to our question "How do you and your colleagues obtain the knowledge you need?" we have a hodgepodge of experimentation, product-advertising videos and books. It can work, but it will take time. And time, as the old saying goes, is money.

Fortunately there is a way of obtaining the knowledge in a more structured and concrete way: the [Developing with SpecFlow Course](http://www.specflow.org/developing-with-specflow-course-agenda/). It is a three day course, and each day focuses on a different set of activities. Product Owners and Business Analysts will get the most out of the first day, Architects and Testers will find a lot of interest in day two, and the nuts-and-bolts-type Developers will particularly enjoy day three.

I took this course myself three years ago (when it was still only a two-day course) and it has vastly improved my BDD practise. The part I enjoyed most was about organising step definitions and the driver pattern, that will help keep your automation layer maintainable. I recommended the course to other people back then, and now I recommend it even more: the course has been improved, and now features content about SpecFlow v2 as well.

The next instalment of the course will be held by [Gáspár Nagy](http://gasparnagy.com/), the creator of SpecFlow, in London from 23rd to 25th May. You can book your seat at [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/539-gaspar-nagy-s-developing-with-specflow).

## Summary

If you want to learn how to integrate Behaviour Driven Development in your .NET-based software production cycle, and if you don't want to spend time scraping all information you need from the internet, then the [Developing with SpecFlow Course](http://www.specflow.org/developing-with-specflow-course-agenda/) is for you. I have attended it myself, and vouch for the effectiveness of it. It is worth it! Sign up at [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/539-gaspar-nagy-s-developing-with-specflow).
