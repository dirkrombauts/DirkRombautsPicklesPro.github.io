If you want to learn something properly and want to improve your own abilities, then you will need to study and practice. A craftsman doesn’t learn his craft in a single day, but goes through an apprenticeship and makes practice pieces. A musician learns how to play her instrument from a more experienced musician, and practices daily.

Twice I have tried to teach myself how to play the (bass) guitar. Both times I failed miserably. For my third attempt I hired a teacher to help me overcome the initial hurdles. These days, I play bass guitar for an hour each day and have lots of fun with it.

The same is true for software development and Behaviour Driven Development. Learning these things is much more effective when an experience coach is at hand to guide you through the first steps and to show you the advanced tricks.

In November and December, there are three opportunities to get this kind of support for Behaviour Driven Development and SpecFlow:

- From 14 till 16 November in London: Gáspár Nagy teaches the official “Developing with SpecFlow” course (in English). For more information, please visit [https://skillsmatter.com/courses/539-gaspar-nagy-s-developing-with-specflow](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/539-gaspar-nagy-s-developing-with-specflow).
- From 21 till 22 November in Zurich: Gojko Adzic teaches his „Specification by Example” workshop (in English). For more information, please visit [https://techtalk.at/trainings/specification-by-example-in-zurich/](https://techtalk.at/trainings/specification-by-example-in-zurich/).
- From 12 till 14 December in Vienna: Dirk Rombauts (yours truly) teaches the official “Developing with SpecFlow” course (in German). For more information, please visit [http://www.picklespro.com/xmasspecial/](http://www.picklespro.com/xmasspecial/).

Training and practice are important in order to advance your craft. Take advantage of these opportunities. I, Dirk Rombauts, would be very glad to welcome you at my course in Vienna in December!
