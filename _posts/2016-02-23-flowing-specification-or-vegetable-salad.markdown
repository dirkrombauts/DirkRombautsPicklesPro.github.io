Last week, Aslak Hellesøy [answered](https://www.quora.com/Cucumber-BDD-framework/Why-is-the-Cucumber-tool-for-BDD-named-as-such/answer/Aslak-Hellesøy) the question "Why is the Cucumber tool for BDD named as such?". If you are doing BDD in .NET, you will be will aware that the prevalent BDD tool is not called *Cucumber .NET* or *nCucumber*, but rather [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org).
