Last week, Aslak Hellesøy answered](https://www.quora.com/Cucumber-BDD-framework/Why-is-the-Cucumber-tool-for-BDD-named-as-such/answer/Aslak-Hellesøy) the question "[Why is the Cucumber tool for BDD named as such?](https://www.quora.com/Cucumber-BDD-framework/Why-is-the-Cucumber-tool-for-BDD-named-as-such/answer/Aslak-Hellesøy)". If you are doing BDD in .NET, you will be well aware that the prevalent BDD tool is not called *Cucumber .NET* or *nCucumber*, but rather *[SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org)*. Personally, I like *SpecFlow* much better than *Cucumber*. Here's why.

## Vegetable Salad

Whenever I think of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), I think of vegetables first. And it's not just cucumbers, but the grammar is called [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), which is a [smaller variety of cucumbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber#Gherkin). [Pickles](http://www.picklesdoc.com/), the open source living documentation generator, are conserved gherkins. And [Relish](https://relishapp.com/), a cloud-hosted living documentation generator, is made of cucumbers as well. So we ended up with a wide variety of cucumber-related names. It's cute, it's whimsical - so what is there not to like?

For starters, most business people I've met are people who take their work very seriously, and are not always possessed of a whimsical sense of humour. Getting the buy-in and active support from those business people is a vital component of BDD; after all BDD is about bridging the communication gap between the business world of analysts, end users and project managers on the one hand and the technical world of software developers on the other hand. If the business people don't feel they are being taken seriously by the software developers - because the software developers "want to work with cucumbers and gherkins" - then that active support is hampered. Ditto if the business people don't take the software developers "and their silly tools" seriously.

Pickles used to include a note saying "pickled on day-month-year" in the generated living documentation. After receiving many questions along the lines of "what do you mean by 'pickled on'?", and after many other users of Pickles receiving similar questions, I decided to change it to "generated on day-month-year". Everything was clear after that.

Another aspect is that *Cucumber* doesn't tell us what it does. The name gives no indication as to what the tool is about, or what people are supposed to gain from it. "Is it about cooking? Gardening? Oh, it's about BDD ..."

## Flowing Specification

Let's now turn to SpecFlow. Right off the bat, the name tells us that this is about specifications. And it's a "flowing specification", which nicely links with Agile, since agile is about establishing a continous flow of work.

No longer do business people frown when they hear the name of the tool: SpecFlow is a serious name, fit for serious business. I've seen many raised eyebrows at the mention of Cucuber and its related term, but never at the mention of SpecFlow

## What's in a Name?

Shakespeare famously has Juliet ask "[what's in a name?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet)": Romeo is perfect except for the name Montague. I think that Cucumber is one of the best things to happen to software development in the last decade, but the name SpecFlow is a much better fit.
