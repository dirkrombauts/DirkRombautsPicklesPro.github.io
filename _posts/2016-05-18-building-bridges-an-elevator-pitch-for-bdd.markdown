It's no secret that I'm setting myself up for a new career as a BDD coach. In preparation I'm taking part in a number of workshops, for example about marketing. During that workshop, I had to describe what a BDD coach does, what BDD is about.

<!--more-->

It was surprisingly difficult for me to explain what BDD is about to a non-technical person. After a couple of iterations, I came up with this:

<blockquote>
    <p>Behaviour Driven Development is a technique for analyzing requirements in a software project. It builds a bridge between the technical world of the developers and the non-technical world of the business people. Thanks to that there will be fewer misunderstandings, and you have the security that the time and money you spend on a software project will pay off.</p>
</blockquote>

What do you think? Please let me know!
