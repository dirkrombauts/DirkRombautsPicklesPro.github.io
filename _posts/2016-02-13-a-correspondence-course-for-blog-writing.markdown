I'll admit it: as a child, I used to make fun of correspondence courses. They somehow didn't seem a serious way to learn. Growing up in Belgium, I naturally read a lot of [Franco-Belgian comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Belgian_comics) and every so often those included a joke about correspondence courses. Usually someone would need mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, one character would say to another character "Hey X, didn't you say you learned how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation" to which X would mumble "it was only a correspondence course".

However, sometimes things change. I recently decided to start this blog to write about Behaviour Driven Development, and when my former colleague [G치sp치r Nagy](http://gasparnagy.com/) wrote [about an online blog course](http://gasparnagy.com/2016/01/blogging-under-pressure/), I was intrigued. I thought "when G치sp치r, whom I like and respect, thinks that this is somehow worth it, then it can't be all that bad. Maybe I can learn from it as well."
